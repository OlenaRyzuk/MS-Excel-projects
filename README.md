# Retail-sales-analysis (real-world data)
This project presents a retail sales analysis based on data divided by month, product category, and weekday. The goal is to build an informative dashboard in Excel, highlight key business insights, and provide actionable recommendations. Note: Data and dashboard labels are in Ukrainian, as the case is based on a real retail example.

üîß # Tools Used
Excel (pivot tables, charts, KPIs dashboard)

üìä # Dashboard Highlights
The dashboard includes:
- Monthly inventory analysis (sales, stock received, sell-through rate)
- Sales by product category for August
- Number of receipts and average receipt value
- Average daily sales in August
- Sales variability (minimum vs. maximum daily sales)
- Top-3 categories‚Äô share of total turnover

‚úÖ # Insights:
- The store‚Äôs total turnover shows a growth trend over the analyzed period. In August, the turnover amounted to 3,894,461 UAH, which is 17.6% higher than in May.
- The average daily sales in August were 125,404 UAH, with values ranging from 87,330 to 157,094 UAH. This indicates that sales fluctuate significantly depending on the day of the week due to varying customer activity.
- The most successful days are Friday and Monday. On Fridays, customers prepare for the weekend, which increases sales. On Mondays, customers run out of some products at home and decide to restock.
- The top-3 selling categories in August were Cigarettes, Meat Products, and Sweets. Together, they account for 38% of total turnover. This suggests that the store‚Äôs turnover is fairly diversified, and other categories also contribute significantly to profit generation.
- The store‚Äôs merchandising strategy is effective, as the sell-through rate gradually increased and reached 126% in August, which is 13 percentage points higher than in July.
- Effective inventory management is also reflected in the growth of the average receipt value and the number of receipts over the analyzed period.
- The least successful day of the week is Sunday, as customers usually rest at home and prefer not to go out, preparing for the upcoming workweek. However, if a holiday falls on Sunday, customer activity noticeably increases.
